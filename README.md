Knowing more publications to submit to and get inspiration from would be nice. I earned a little from Medium, but it is increasing, and I want to keep the increasing rate. I know submitting to publications help, A LOT, so I explored the top publications and made a list, dividing them into eight categories. I hope it will help everyone, including myself, who wants to write and thrive on Medium.
